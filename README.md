eCommerce

A simple Ebay "clone"

Using Python/Django on the backend and Bootstrap, HTML and custom CSS on the frontend

Users are able to create an account, and when logged in are able to create new listings and bid on current listings

What I would like to still implement:
- a feature where users are able to add listings to their watchlist
- The ability for a user to stop the auction on an item that they have listed and then notify the highest bidder somehow
- Clean up the CSS on the categories page and the new-listing page
